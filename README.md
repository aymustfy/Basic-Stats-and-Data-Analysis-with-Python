![Scheme](https://i.imgur.com/3ZficIr.png)

In this repostor, basic statistics and statistical analysis methods are applied in python programming language.

The scheme above was followed during the implementation process. First, parametric tests and then non-parametric tests were applied.

The sequence number-analysis method(number of data used) template has been applied in Python files. The data used is added in a separate folder.
